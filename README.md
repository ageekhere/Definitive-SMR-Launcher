News update 22/09/2025

First release of Definitive-SMR-Launcher, maps within the Internet Archive are slowly being added and I am in the process of applying for a collection. I am still working out the way people can submit new maps, follow the discord to stay up to date. 

The map folder structure is as follows:
```
Name_Of_Map_v1_00.7z
- CustomAssets
- UserMaps
- mapIcon.jpg
- mapInfo.txt
```
File name has no spaces, capital at the start of each word, ends with lower case v with the version number, use 7zip to make a 7z file.

All Custom Assets go in the CustomAssets folder

All map data goes in UserMaps
